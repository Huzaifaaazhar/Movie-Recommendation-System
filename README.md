# Movie Recommendation System
This project aims to build a system that provides personalized movie recommendation system to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Introduction

The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide movie suggestions to users by analyzing their movie ratings and preferences. The system uses machine learning algorithms to understand user behavior and recommend movies that are similar to those the user has liked in the past.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie suggestions tailored to individual user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggest movies based on movie attributes and user profile.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users and movies.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional for deep learning approaches)
  - NLTK / SpaCy (for natural language processing)
  - Python NLP (for natural language processing tasks)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the development environment and load the datasets and models.
2. Use the provided scripts to interact with the recommendation system.

## Datasets

The recommendation system uses the following datasets:
- **MovieLens Dataset**: Contains movie ratings and metadata. This dataset is used for training and evaluating the recommendation models.

## Models

The system employs the following recommendation models:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD, KNN) to recommend movies based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses features of movies (e.g., genres, tags) to recommend similar movies to those a user has liked.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods.

## Evaluation

The performance of the recommendation models is evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the difference between the predicted and actual ratings.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Precision@K and Recall@K**: Measures the accuracy of the top-K recommendations.

## Results

The results of the recommendation system are summarized in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. Detailed evaluation metrics and performance graphs are provided in the `results` directory.
